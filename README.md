# Mental-Health-Analysis-based-on-Survey
In this project we conducted a survey on the mental health which aims to advance knowledge of the mental issues faced by some vulnerable segments by examining the some of the common conditions like gender, age, family history, employees etc which results in mental issues. Vulnerable segmentation is the process of identifying groups of people facing mental issues and designing mental treatment based on common characteristics and unique needs for each group. Vulnerable segments will vary for every organisation depending on the environment and employees. Segmentation theorists often suggest that `female' employees in industry suffer lot of mental problems. In this project we will describe patterns and trends within different groups in order to determine the vulnerable groups which require mental treatment. This project focuses on creating a model which will predict whether a person needs mental treatment based on his inputs like family and environment
